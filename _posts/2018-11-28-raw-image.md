These are gallery tests for image wrapped in `<figure>` elements.

To place a gallery add the necessary YAML Front Matter:

And then drop-in the gallery include --- gallery `caption` is optional.


<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2018-02-23 16.41.17.jpg" width="90%" style="display:block;margin:2em auto 2em;"/>


This is some text after the gallery just to make sure that everything aligns properly.

Here comes another gallery, this time set the `id` to match 2nd gallery hash in YAML Front Matter.
